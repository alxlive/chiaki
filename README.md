# This fork

This is a tiny fork of the Chiaki project. Its only improvement is support for
the Touchpad button (i.e. deep-pressing on the touchpad on the PS4 controller).
Previously, this was not supported, so one had to press "T" on the laptop
keyboard to simulate a touchpad press. This was an inconvenience in games that
used this button, such as Final Fantasy 7 Remake.

# Pre-built binary

I've pre-built the Mac OSX binary and shared it on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1awbz263Ghe_0U7_HWKG2ieg-cmrkdhx0?usp=sharing).

You shouldn't trust pre-built binaries downloaded from a random source on the
Internet. But since I found it fairly difficult to build Chiaki on OSX, I'm
providing this binary for convenience.
