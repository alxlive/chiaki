# This fork

This is a tiny fork of the Chiaki project. Its only improvement is support for
the Touchpad button (i.e. deep-pressing on the touchpad on the PS4 controller).
Previously, this was not supported, so one had to press "T" on the laptop
keyboard to simulate a touchpad press. This was an inconvenience in games that
used this button, such as Final Fantasy 7 Remake.
